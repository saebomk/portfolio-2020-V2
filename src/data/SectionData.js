We delivered 2 versions of mockups (short-term and long-term) that can align with the design system. • Personally, I worked remotely for 90% of the project due to the pandemic, and this was a great opportunity to learn how to effectively collaborate with the team. (Thankfully, we were able to work on Figma and that immensely helped to feel the presence) Visualizing, and preparing visual aid for meetings helped me the most.",

With one design intern, I listed out all in-development patterns and their variations. The full migration took 1 month and updated upon new projects.
