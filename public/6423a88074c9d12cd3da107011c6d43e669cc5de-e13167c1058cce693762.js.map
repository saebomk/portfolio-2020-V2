Therefore, I collected user feedback to identify what are the most common parameters for the search. Meanwhile, we collaborated with the data science team to come up with the use cases where recommendations can be useful. As a result, I came up with 2 refined user stories that can use recommendations and search.\",\n      diagram: \"../../images/animations/conditionbuilder_3.gif\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Design\",\n      subtitle: \"Creating Simple Expressions\",\n      description:\n        \"When creating new conditions, admins can create rows and groups before/after/inside each row and group\",\n      diagram: \"../../images/animations/conditionbuilder_4.gif\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Design\",\n      subtitle: \"Creating Complex Expressions\",\n      description:\n        \"If there are multiple criteria, admin can collapse and expand groups\",\n      diagram: \"../../images/animations/conditionbuilder_5.gif\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Interaction\",\n      subtitle: \"\",\n      description:\n        \"I delivered fully interactive Figma mocks and detailed specs for the responsive dialogs that can accommodate complex conditions with multiple groups and rows.\",\n      diagram: \"../../images/animations/conditionbuilder_6.svg\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Lessons Learned\",\n      subtitle: \"\",\n      description:\n        \"While it's easy to just remove the cluttered, the real value comes out from making the cluttered decluttered. I first focused on understanding how the feature works thoroughly and understand the use cases. • Using dialogs in moderation, giving contextual information is good but the feature can be bigger than you thought. • For working with UX engineers, defining each element clearly and their roles early on are important to make common ground. • Always keep accessibility in mind, show labels and any changes always visible.\",\n      diagram: \"\",\n    },\n  ],\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nexport default function FullProjectBackground() {\n  return (\n    <Wrapper>\n      <div className=\"mockup1\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup2\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup3\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup4\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup5\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup6\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup7\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup8\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup9\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup10\" />\n      <div className=\"mockup11\" />\n    </Wrapper>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Wrapper = styled.div`\n  position: relative;\n  display: block;\n  height: 720px;\n  z-index: 100;\n\n  /* perspective: 5000;\n  perspective-origin: bottom left;
